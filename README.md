NOTE: Sometimes I have noticed that the health pickup still gets consumed by enemy objects, but only rarely when cloning this repo into a fresh folder. No clue why it happens, but chances are redownloading the repo will fix it because I can positively confirm that the code should be doing what it's intended to do
